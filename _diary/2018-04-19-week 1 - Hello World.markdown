## Sat
I wrote to Dani a draft for now! I did not go to the Bonanza cupping! I wanted to do something
out of the ordinary. Feel a bit depressed to do always the ame things. but not go to the cupping was
actually harder! feel still depressed.. 
I worked on the website again. I worked on the logo in Gravit for a few hours but could not do it
At the end did not look good that multitude in style of Mdn..
Anyway. Sun shines. Ukulele! happy by Pharrell.

## Sun

Made my day. Feel lonely though. Nix going on today apart for the cupping.
