I offered Sara to make her website.
Will see Markus today. Forgot my lunch and I am at school!! will be fasting day..
I did some. done FreeCodeCamp today
School > Markus. could not fix the bike because havent got tools.  

## Tue 
still woke up at 5.30... 
FCC at school .  JS is a bit boring but interesting because of having to get the syntax right!
checking out constantin's water workshop again. forgot my earplugs. ah this class is noisy!

evening done some FCC JS quizzes. then Markus bike. speiche in, aber etwas zu lang. ritzel ist abgenutzt
brauche neue ritzel, neue kette, neue speiche abschleifen evt, rad muss "trued"noch

## Wed
motherboard. windows 10 installiert an der schule (roll eyes !)
habe ganz viel ueber coffee gelesen.. subtitles downloaded von Youtube channels.
Ralf von the Barn, Colonna Dashwood
mache mit FCC jaascript weiter. super cool! weite JS!

danach water workshop at the barn!!
which was mega but Andrew did not explain the things properly...I should do a Youtube video..
maybe in 4 parts and explain all the things I got from constantin and maxwell colonna vids..
then we had 10 coffees to cup. the waters were, QC,RO, TAP, High buffer, high Mg, low Mg, distilled water .. other different ratios
including a great coffee water.

## THU
Museum der Technik und spektrum. Flat tire on the way to the museum. rain. cold. quite miserable experience.
I spent the whole day there till 16:00. exhausting to walk so much - I did not see anybody after the first meeting. 
Quite embarassing... the museum was huge. The lok as in 999 galaxy express.. the old bikes.. the airplanes, the boats. the shitty zucker museum 
which is quite a fraud! the weaving .. o .. the Zuse computer! the spektrum was more for kids but I found some interesting stuff about colours. By then 
I was too exhausted. I repaired my wheel and went home . made pizza dough and bread dough simpified because I had to go to sleep!
 
 
## FRI
self study. tried pedal with cleats only right foot. works!
Looked up very interesting stack overflow job sites with Magix in Berlin. Should try to do a praktikum there.

I also just noticed that I lost files due to Git..! what I dont have committed between commits has gone! even I did a back up, 
because back up was a git repo hahahaha luckily nothing too major.
