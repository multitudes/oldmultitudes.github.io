## about me

<p class="message">
  Hey there! I am Laurent Brusa and this is my page.
</p>

I love the new opportunities created by computers since the web was born, and want to contribute and be in the winning team at the crossroads of liberal arts and technology.

I am a multi-linguist in a technology driven business. I speak and write fluent English and have a demonstrable knowledge of several European languages.

* My areas of interests include C, C++, Full stack, front and back end with PHP JS and JQuery. I also love Python and started to get into Machine and Deep Learning since summer of 2018 and I would be very excited to do something in this field too. I love macs and I am at ease with a linux terminal too.
* I love specialty coffee and on the weekends you might see me on my bike going to visit coffee cuppings in town..
