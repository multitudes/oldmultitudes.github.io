Hi, I'm Laurent. I’m a developer and aspiring polymath  

My areas of interests include C, C++, full stack, front and back end with PHP, JS, and JQuery. I also love Python and started to get into Machine and Deep Learning since summer of 2018 thanks to the great online courses offered by Jeremy Howard of fast.ai. I work on macs and I am at ease with a linux terminal.

I am excited by the new opportunities created by computers and the advances in the Artificial Intelligence field and want to be in the winning team at the crossroads of liberal arts and technology.

I am a multi-linguist in a technology driven business. I have a demonstrable knowledge of several European languages.

I love specialty coffee and on the weekends you might see me on my bike going to look for coffee cuppings in town..
