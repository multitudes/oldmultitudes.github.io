Hi, I am Laurent. 
<br>

I am passionate about developing for iOS, about sound and music applications, natural language application, education and deep learning applied to computer vision.

I live in Germany and successfully completed the two years courses for the IHK (German Chamber Of Commerce) Developer Certificate in 2020.
 
I did the online courses on Artificial Intelligence offered by Jeremy Howard of [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) and by the [Helsinki University](https://www.elementsofai.com). 

My preferred languages include Swift, C, C++, full stack, front and back end with PHP, JS. I also love Python! 

I love specialty coffee and on the weekends you might see me on my bike going to look for coffee cuppings in town. 

Here you can see [my Portfolio](https://github.com/multitudes/portfolio) and my public repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/multitudes/).
