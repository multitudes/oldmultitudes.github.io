  Hi there! I am Laurent Brusa and this is my profile.

I am excited by the new opportunities created by computers and the advances in the Artificial Intelligence field in the last 30 years and want to contribute and be in the winning team at the crossroads of liberal arts and technology.

I am a multi-linguist in a technology driven business. I speak and write fluent English and have a demonstrable knowledge of several European languages.

My areas of interests include C, C++, full stack, front and back end with PHP, JS, and JQuery. I also love Python and started to get into Machine and Deep Learning since summer of 2018 thanks to the great online courses offered by Jeremy Howard of fast.ai. I work on macs and I am at ease with a linux terminal.

I love specialty coffee and on the weekends you might see me on my bike going to look for coffee cuppings in town..
