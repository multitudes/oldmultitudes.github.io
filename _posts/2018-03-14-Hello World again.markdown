I did not think I would get interested in 3D printing until I printed my first figure that's it. I am now done for.
My first print is a forest spirit from the anime movie "Princess Mononoke".

This post should be called "hello 3D World" instead, but I didn't want to give away the contents.
For the first time I had a proper introduction in 3D printing and the software used to create the models.
The printer we used are the Anet A8 and A6. These are the cheapest models currently available to buy online. They are made in China and require a manual assemblywhich can tak easily a whole day and the instructions are really badly written and explained. Well that was fun!

Taking it from there we can customize or upgrade the printers with better parts, or 3D printing part we need.
Usually the first upgrade can easily be the bearings of the gliders, the suspensions of the plate can be changed to silicon for a better stability etc.

The first prints are usually to calibrate. there is a cube, and an so called "heat tower" to get the best printing temperature.
There are actually two involved. The extruder's temperature and the bed temperature. Those depends of the material used. Lets say for the PLA a bed temp of 60 C and an extruder's temp of 210 C would not be too far of the mark.

Software. 
Autodesk has a free online tool called "Tinkercad" and it is amazing.
Another free software, "Blender" has a much steeper learning curve.
"Cura" is used to prepare the 3D file to be printed. 
We used a Rasperry Pi connected to a webcam to monitor the print. Look for "Octoprint".

Acetone can be used to smooth the models printed with ABS but will not work for others such as PLA!
