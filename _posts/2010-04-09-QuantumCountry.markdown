(This are my own notes about the "Quantum Country" article written by Matushek and Nielsen, see sources).
Here on Earth, the principal originator of computers was the English mathematician Alan Turing. In his paper  “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem” (published in 1936), he was attacking a problem about the nature of mathematics posed by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928.
Hilbert’s problem asked whether a general algorithm exists, which a mathematician can follow which would let them figure out whether any given mathematical statement is provable.
Attacking Hilbert’s problem forced Turing to precise exactly what was meant by an algorithm. 
To do this, Turing described what we now call a Turing machine: a single, universal programmable computing device that Turing argued could perform any algorithm whatsoever. Turing’s machine became the gold standard: an algorithm was what we could perform on a Turing machine.
David Deutsch suggested a deeper approach to the problem of defining what is meant by an algorithm.
Algorithms have to be performed on some kind of physical system. It can be any system.
Will aliens have computers? 
In this sense, computers aren’t just human inventions. 
They are a fundamental feature of the universe, the answer to a simple and profound question about how the universe works. 
And they have likely been discovered over and over again by many alien intelligences. 
Deutsch observed that ordinary, everyday computers based on Turing’s model have a lot of trouble simulating quantum mechanical systems (Researchers such as Yu Manin and Richard Feynman had previously observed this, and as a result had speculated about computers based on quantum mechanics.)
To answer his question affirmatively, Deutsch was forced to invent a new type of computing system, a quantum computer. 
Those quantum computers can do everything conventional computers can do, but are also capable of efficiently simulating quantum-mechanical processes.
