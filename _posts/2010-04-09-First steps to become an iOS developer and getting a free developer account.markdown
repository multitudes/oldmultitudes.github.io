### Creating a free Apple ID for Xcode

If you are starting out developing your apps, trying out a few things and you are not yet ready to commit to the fee of 99 USD a year for an Apple developer account, then you need only to create an Apple ID to activate Xcode and create a provisioning profile to run your apps on your devices.



#### Adding your Apple ID to Xcode



Before we can build to a device, we need to set up an Apple ID and add it to Xcode.

If you donâ€™t yet have an Apple ID, obtain one from the [Apple ID site](http://appleid.apple.com/).

Once you have obtained an Apple ID, you must add it to Xcode.

Use Accounts preferences in Xcode to add your Apple ID, remote source code repositories, and Xcode Servers and to manage your developer account signing assets.
To open Accounts preferences, choose Xcode > Preferences and click Accounts.

From the menu bar at the top of the screen choose Xcode > Preferences. This will open the Preferences window.
Choose Accounts at the top of the window to display information about the Apple IDs that have been added to Xcode.
To add your Apple ID, click the plus sign at the bottom left corner and choose Add Apple ID.
