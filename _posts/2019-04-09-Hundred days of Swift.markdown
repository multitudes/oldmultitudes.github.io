I have been recently very much enjoying the 100 days of Swift by Paul Hudson.  
The only thing I am missing is sometimes when I am looking for old content. There is no index on the website and after a certain number of projects under your belt you feel the need to revisit some of the staff. Where was that petition API again ? 

This is the missing index for the 100 days of Swift! 

## Introduction to Swift - Days 1 - 12  

Basic Swift learning! All what you need to know about optionals and closures etc.
See my other post with more details [here](https://multitudes.github.io/2019/04/Some-Swift-tips-for-beginner-and-intermediate.html).
