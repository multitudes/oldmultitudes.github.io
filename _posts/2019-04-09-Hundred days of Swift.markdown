# This is a draft

## 
I have been recently very much enjoying the 100 days of Swift by Paul Hudson.  
The only thing I am missing is sometimes when I am looking for old content. There is no index on the website and after a certain number of projects under your belt you feel the need to revisit some of the staff. Where was that petition API again ? 

This is the missing index for the 100 days of Swift! 

## Days 1 - 12

Basic Swift learning! All what you need to know about optionals and closures etc.
See my other post with more details here as well
